            A smart home system using Node MCU is 
            a popular solution for controlling home a
            ppliances and devices using the Internet of
             Things (IoT) technology. <br>
             The system consists of a Node MCU microcontroller board, 
             which is programmed with firmware that enables it to communicate with various sensors, 
             actuators, and other smart devices.<br> 
             The system can be connected to 
             the internet through Wi-Fi, 
             allowing users to control and 
             monitor their home from 
             anywhere in the world using a mobile app or a web-based interface. 
             The smart home system can automate various tasks, 
             such as turning on and off lights, adjusting the thermostat, and opening and closing doors, 
             based on predetermined schedules or user-defined triggers.
              The use of Node MCU in smart home systems provides a cost-effective and flexible solution that can be customized to suit individual requirements, 
              making it an attractive option for homeowners 
              and developers alike.
